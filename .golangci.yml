    # Please note that other Go modules have issues that are ignored but are
    # not listed here. The reason is that linting must be done standing on the
    # Go module and excluding issues here uses relative paths. That means that
    # the relative paths from this file start from the root of sdk but for
    # other modules the relative path start from that module. For that reason,
    # linting is ignored by using the following syntax on a line: //nolint. If
    # you look for uses of //nolint you will find the other linting issues
    # being excluided.
