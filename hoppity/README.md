# ![ears](img/ears.png) Hoppity

A tour of data store modeling with Hop.

```
Christopher Robin goes
Hoppity, hoppity,
Hoppity, hoppity, hop.
Whenever I tell him
Politely to stop it, he
Says he can't possibly stop.

If he stopped hopping,
He couldn't go anywhere,
Poor little Christopher
Couldn't go anywhere...
That's why he always goes
Hoppity, hoppity,
Hoppity,
Hoppity,
Hop.

-- A. A. Milne

Nextmv's decision modeling interface lets you automate any operational decision 
in a way that looks and feels like writing other code. Hop provides the 
guardrails to turn your data into automated decisions, and test and deploy them 
into production environments.

Let's see how.
