# Route

Deprecated: This package is deprecated and will be removed in the next major release.
Use [nextroute][nextroute] instead.

Package `route` provides vehicle routing functionalities. Routing models direct
vehicles from some start location to an end location, servicing other locations
along the way. These locations often represent customer requests, though they
may logically correspond to any number of things. Such models attempt to
service all locations optimizing a value, such as minimizing cost.

See [godocs][godocs] for package docs.
