/*
Package osrm provides a client for measuring distances and durations.

An OSRM client requests distance and duration data from an OSRM server. It
makes requests to construct a matrix measure.

These measures implement route.ByIndex.

Deprecated: This package is deprecated and will be removed in the next major release.
It is used with the router engine which was replaced by
[github.com/nextmv-io/sdk/measure/osrm].
