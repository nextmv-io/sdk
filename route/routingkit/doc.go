/*
Package routingkit provides measures that calculate the cost of travelling
between points on road networks. It relies on Open Street Map (OSM) files
without the need for a server.

Deprecated: This package is deprecated and will be removed in the next major release.
It is used with the router engine which was replaced by
[github.com/nextmv-io/sdk/measure/routingkit].
